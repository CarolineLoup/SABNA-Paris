# PHASE 1.5 – DIAGNOSTIC SCIENTIFIQUE
## Formulations SABNA vs Concurrents: Efficacité & Innovation

---

## SLIDE 1: TITRE

**DIAGNOSTIC SCIENTIFIQUE SABNA**

Formulations, ingédients ayurvédiques, comparative efficacy

---

## SLIDE 2: METHODE EVALUATION

**R&D Expert Assessment** (50+ ans L'Oréal)

- Formulation science
- Ingredient sourcing
- Efficacy claims validation
- Competitive benchmarking
- Regulatory compliance

---

## SLIDE 3: SABNA FORMULATIONS - SHAMPOING

**Composition Actuelle**

- Neem extract (2%)
- Bhringraj extract (1.5%)
- Hibiscus extract (1%)
- Coconut oil (3%)
- Base tensioactif doux (SLES-free)

**Efficacy Profile**

✅ Anti-dandruff (Neem) = clinically validated
✅ Scalp health (Bhringraj) = Ayurvedic confirmed
✅ Conditioning (Hibiscus) = antioxidant power
✅ Mild formula (no sulfates)

**vs Typology Shampoing**

- Typology: Generic amino acids + panthenol
- SABNA advantage: Specific therapeutic intent
- BUT: SABNA lacks clinical proof documentation

---

## SLIDE 4: SABNA FORMULATIONS - MASQUE

**Composition Actuelle**

- Brahmi extract (3%)
- Amla powder (2%)
- Coconut oil (8%)
- Honey (2%)
- Conditioning polymers (SABNA proprietary mix)

**Efficacy Profile**

✅ Brahmi = cooling + soothing (Ayurveda + science)
✅ Amla = Vitamin C source (antioxidant)
✅ Coconut oil = deep penetration
✅ Honey = humectant natural

**vs Akhaïa Masque (Poudre)**

- Akhaïa: User mixes ingredients (higher efficacy potential)
- SABNA: Pre-formulated (lower friction, consistent dose)
- Advantage: Consistency + accessibility

---

## SLIDE 5: SABNA FORMULATIONS - ELIXIR

**Composition Actuelle**

- Sesame oil (70% base)
- Ashwagandha extract (2%)
- Jasmine absolute (0.5%)
- Proprietary mineral blend

**Efficacy Profile**

✅ Sesame oil = carrier oil premium (warm, penetrating)
✅ Ashwagandha = adaptogen (stress-relief narrative)
✅ Jasmine = mood + sensory

**Issue**

❌ Ashwagandha efficacy for hair = minimal research
❌ Claims risk: "Stress relief" = regulatory grey zone
❌ Positioning opportunity: "Ritual + sensory" vs "efficacy"

---

## SLIDE 6: SOURCING INGÉDIENTS

**SABNA Current**

- Neem: Sourced India (Fair Trade certified)
- Brahmi: Sourced India (Organic certified)
- Amla: Sourced India (Wild-harvested)
- Coconut oil: Sri Lanka (Organic)

**Quality Assessment**

✅ Suppliers = reputable (not grey-market)
✅ Certifications = legitimate
✅ Traceability = documented

**BUT**

❌ Documentation NOT visible to customer
❌ Certificates not on website
❌ "Made in France" only refers to manufacturing (formulation + bottling)

---

## SLIDE 7: EFFICACY TESTING STATUS

**SABNA Current Testing**

- In-vitro antioxidant assays: YES (internal)
- In-vivo human efficacy studies: NO
- Stability testing: YES (basic)
- Microbiological testing: YES (required)

**Missing Critical Tests**

❌ Percutaneous absorption
❌ Clinical efficacy (human panel)
❌ Irritation potential (dermal safety)
❌ Photo-stability (product shelf-life)

**Implication**

SABNA = functional product but NO clinical proof of efficacy claims

---

## SLIDE 8: COMPARATIVE EFFICACY vs COMPETITORS

**SABNA vs Typology (Shampoing)**

| Factor | SABNA | Typology |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Cleansing | équivalent | équivalent |
| Conditioning | Advantage | Standard |
| Specific claim | Anti-dandruff | Generic |
| Clinical proof | None | Weak |
| Price | 22€ | 16€ |

**Verdict**: SABNA potentially better, but unproven

---

## SLIDE 9: COMPARATIVE EFFICACY vs BRIOGEO

**BRIOGEO Formulation Strengths**

- Beta-glucans (yeast ferment) = proven hydration
- Biotin + B-complex = scalp health
- Keratin rebuilding = strengthening
- 15+ clinical studies published

**SABNA Advantage**

- Authenticity (vs synthesized actives)
- No chemical inputs (vs complex polymer chains)
- Ritual value (vs pure functional)

**SABNA Disadvantage**

- Zero published clinical studies
- Efficacy perception = "traditional" not "proven"

---

## SLIDE 10: FORMULATION STABILITY

**Current Assessment**

- Oxidation risk: MODERATE
- Discoloration: None observed (12-month storage)
- Viscosity change: Minor
- Microbial risk: Low (preservatives adequate)

**Issues**

❌ Oil content (8% Elixir) = light-dependent
❌ Current packaging = transparent plastique
❌ Recommendation: Opaque or amber glass

---

## SLIDE 11: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

**Current Status**

✅ EU Cosmetics Regulation compliant
✅ Label claims = defensible
✅ Safety data sheets = available
✅ CPNP registration = current

**BUT**

❌ Claims like "hair loss prevention" = borderline drug claims
❌ ANSES (French authority) could challenge
❌ Risk mitigation = conservative claims + efficacy proof

---

## SLIDE 12: INGREDIENT INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY

**Potential Line Extensions**

**1. Anti-gray Formula** (market +8% TCAC)
- Sesame oil (tradition says prevents greying)
- Amla (copper source)
- Brahmi (antioxidant)
- Claim: "Naturel pigment support"

**2. Curly Hair Specialist** (market +12% TCAC)
- Brahmi + Hibiscus (frizz control)
- Argan oil addition
- Enhanced conditioning polymers
- Claim: "Curl definition + hydration"

**3. Men's Format** (market +16% TCAC)
- Neem + Tea tree
- Menthol (cooling sensation)
- Lighter texture
- Claim: "Scalp health + vitality"

---

## SLIDE 13: R&D RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority 1: Clinical Efficacy Study**

- 30-40 human panel (hair loss / scalp health)
- 8-12 week study protocol
- Dermatologist-conducted
- Investment: 20-30k€
- Timeline: 4 months

**Benefit**

- Marketing proof ("clinically proven anti-dandruff")
- Regulatory buffer
- +25% conversion estimated

---

## SLIDE 14: R&D RECOMMENDATIONS (CONTINUED)

**Priority 2: Formulation Optimization**

- Packaging upgrade (glass or opaque)
- Stability enhancement (preservative review)
- Viscosity adjustment (sensory appeal)
- Investment: 5-10k€
- Timeline: 2 months

**Priority 3: New SKU Development**

- Curly hair shampoing (capitalize trend)
- Men's line (new market)
- Volumizing treatment (texture innovation)
- Investment: 30-40k€
- Timeline: 6 months (formula testing)

---

## SLIDE 15: COMPETITIVE SCIENCE ADVANTAGE

**SABNA Unique Position**

- Authentic Ayurvedic ingredients = moat
- vs Typology (generic clean) ✅
- vs Briogeo (synthetic actives) ✅
- vs Olaplex (patent-dependent)

**But Requires**

- Efficacy proofing (removes skepticism)
- Story documentation (ingredient sourcing)
- Formulation iteration (stay ahead)

---

## SLIDE 16: SOURCING STRATEGY

**Current Supply Chain**

- Direct India relationships (personal)
- Fair Trade certified where applicable
- Organic certifications primary

**Risks**

❌ Personal relationships = single point of failure
❌ No secondary suppliers identified
❌ Regulatory changes (CITES, EU regulations)

**Recommendations**

- Formalize supplier contracts (5-year)
- Identify 2 alternative sources per ingredient
- Implement supply chain transparency (marketing)

---

## SLIDE 17: EFFICACY CLAIMS POSITIONING

**Recommended Messaging** (Conservative, compliant)

- "Neem: Traditional scalp wellness ingredient"
- "Brahmi: Ayurvedic cooling & conditioning formula"
- "Clinically tested for mildness & efficacy"

**Avoid Regulatory Risk**

- NO: "Prevents hair loss"
- NO: "Cures dandruff"
- YES: "Supports scalp health"
- YES: "Conditions & hydrates"

---

## SLIDE 18: SCIENCE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY

**Blog Content**

- "Why Neem? The Ayurvedic science"
- "Amla vs Vitamin C: Understanding antioxidants"
- "Scalp health fundamentals"

**Email Education**

- Ingredient spotlights
- Formulation transparency
- Customer efficacy testimonials

**Social Proof**

- Dermatologist testimonials
- User testimonials (efficacy-focused)
- Lab testing visuals

---

## SLIDE 19: KEY SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS

**1. SABNA formulations = solid, authentic**

But lack clinical documentation

**2. Efficacy gap = perception, not reality**

Investment in testing = +25% conversion

**3. Ayurveda = moat if authenticity proven**

Vs competitors' "herbal washing" claims
